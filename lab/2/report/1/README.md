## Fritzing
The software is created in the spirit of the Processing programming language and the Arduino microcontroller[4] and allows a designer, artist, researcher, or hobbyist to document their Arduino-based prototype and create a PCB layout for manufacturing.

## Using Fritzing to create a sketch and connect the components
 We create a sketch with components (Arduino UNO, BME280, Piezo Buzzer, ESP32 - DevKit, resistor)
